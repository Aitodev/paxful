It's a small price to pay for maintaining desired level of privacy.

DUSPS provides a range of free supplies for their prepaid services.\r\n\r\nTracking number: Use tracking number as your confirmation of payment.\r\n\r\nEstablishing trust:  Look for vendors with good ratings. Do a test run with a vendor for a lower amount.  By making a test run you would minimize exposure to the risk of loss when dealing with the unfamiliar vendor.\r\n\r\nCost:  Cash in the mail may appear a bit pricier than using Western Union or Money Gram.
